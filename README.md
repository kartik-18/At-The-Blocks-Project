## Overview

This project is an updated version of a dashboard initially styled using traditional CSS. The primary goal was to enhance the project's styling and maintainability by transitioning to Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a highly efficient way to build modern and responsive user interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

   git clone https://github.com/kartik-18/At-The-Blocks-Project.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd At-The-Blocks-Project
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Run the project:

This will start the development server, and you can access the dashboard at http://localhost:3000
